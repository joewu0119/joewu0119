University of Utah

These connections were made in 1969, marking the beginning of ARPANET, which would evolve into the modern Internet.


#2.What does the term packet mean? A packet refers to a small unit of data that is transmitted over a network. When data is sent over the Internet, it is broken down into packets, which are sent individually and can take different paths to their destination. Once they arrive, they are reassembled into the original data. This is a key principle of packet-switching in networking.

#3.Which came first, the Internet or the World Wide Web? The Internet came first. The Internet, which is a global network of interconnected computers, began developing in the 1960s and 1970s. The World Wide Web (WWW), which is a system for accessing and sharing information over the Internet through websites, was developed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee.

#4.What was revolutionary about Web 2.0? Web 2.0 marked a shift from static, informational websites to dynamic, interactive platforms that allowed user-generated content, collaboration, and social networking. It introduced features like social media, blogs, wikis, and sharing platforms, enabling users to actively contribute and interact with content, rather than just consuming it. Key aspects of Web 2.0 include the rise of platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Wikipedia.

#5.What was the so-called killer app for the Internet? The killer app for the Internet was email. It was one of the earliest and most widely used applications that demonstrated the power and utility of the Internet, making it indispensable for communication. This helped drive the adoption of the Internet for personal and professional use.

#6.What does the term VoIP mean? VoIP stands for Voice over Internet Protocol. It is a technology that allows voice communication to take place over the Internet rather than through traditional telephone lines. VoIP converts voice into digital data and transmits it via the Internet. Popular VoIP services include Skype, Zoom, and WhatsApp.

#7.What is a LAN? A LAN (Local Area Network) is a network of computers and devices that are connected within a limited geographic area, such as a home, office, or campus. LANs typically use Ethernet or Wi-Fi to connect devices and enable file sharing, resource sharing, and communication.

#8.What is the difference between an intranet and an extranet?

Intranet: A private network that is restricted to members of an organization, providing access to internal resources, documents, and communication tools. It is typically protected by firewalls and accessible only within the organization.

Extranet: An extension of an intranet that allows limited access to outsiders, such as business partners, suppliers, or customers. It provides a secure way to share information or collaborate with external parties, often via a VPN (Virtual Private Network).

#9.What is Metcalfe’s Law? Metcalfe’s Law is a principle that states the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users (N²). In other words, as more users join a network, the network becomes exponentially more valuable, because each new user can potentially connect with all other users. This law highlights the importance of network effects in the growth and value of social and communication networks like the Internet.
