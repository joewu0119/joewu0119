# 1.What is an Information System?


An Information System (IS) is a structured system designed to collect, store, manage, and disseminate information. It integrates technology, people,
and processes to support decision-making, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization within an organization.

1.Foundation of Decision-Making: Data provides the essential information needed for analysis, reporting, and informed decision-making.
2.Quality Matters: The accuracy, relevance, and timeliness of data significantly affect the system’s effectiveness and the quality of insights derived from it.
3.Value Creation: Well-managed data can lead to valuable insights, helping organizations identify trends, improve operations, and enhance customer experiences.
