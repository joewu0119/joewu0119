# 1. CPU (Central Processing Unit)
Speed Measurement: Typically measured in gigahertz (GHz).
Performance: A higher GHz indicates faster processing capability. Modern CPUs often have multiple cores, which improves multitasking.

# 2. Motherboard
Speed Measurement: Bus speeds, often measured in megahertz (MHz).
Performance: Determines the rate at which data is transferred between the CPU, RAM, and other components. Modern motherboards support speeds ranging from 100 MHz to over 4000 MHz.

# 3. RAM (Random Access Memory)
Speed Measurement: Measured in megahertz (MHz) for DDR (Double Data Rate) RAM.
Performance: Typical speeds range from 2133 MHz to 3600 MHz or higher. Faster RAM improves data access times and overall system responsiveness.

# 4. Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
Speed Measurement: Measured in revolutions per minute (RPM) and data transfer rates (MB/s).
Performance: Common speeds are 5400 RPM to 7200 RPM for consumer drives, with data transfer rates typically ranging from 80 MB/s to 160 MB/s.

# 5. SSD (Solid State Drive)
Speed Measurement: Measured in megabytes per second (MB/s).
Performance: SATA SSDs typically offer speeds of 500-600 MB/s, while NVMe SSDs can exceed 3000 MB/s, significantly enhancing boot times and data access.

# 6. USB Drive
Speed Measurement: Measured in megabytes per second (MB/s) based on USB version (e.g., USB 2.0, 3.0, 3.1).
Performance: USB 2.0 drives typically offer speeds up to 60 MB/s, while USB 3.0 can reach up to 625 MB/s, and USB 3.1 can exceed 1,000 MB/s.

# 7. Network
Speed Measurement: Measured in megabits per second (Mbps) or gigabits per second (Gbps).
Performance: Wired Ethernet connections can reach up to 10 Gbps, while typical Wi-Fi speeds range from 300 Mbps (Wi-Fi 5) to several Gbps (Wi-Fi 6).
